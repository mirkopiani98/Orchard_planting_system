This script calculates starting from **input reference points** and desired planting distances as rows and tree's distances, the position of each tree in the orchard. At the end of the process a csv database of trees latitude and longitude locations in WGS84 Datum (epsg 4326) is produced. 

**Before using the code** ensure your Python environment being adapt with:

`pip install pandas`
 
`pip install pyproj` 

### Points reference and related lines
+ **AB line** is intended as the line to which tree rows are parallel;
+ **ROWs ALIGNMENT LINE** is intended as the line from which all the tree rows start;
+ **MAX LON line** is the line of maximum longitude, thus any tree after that line will not be added in the orchard database (`orch_db`);
+ **MAX LAT line** is the line of maximum latitufr, thus any tree above that line will not be added in the `orch_db`.
